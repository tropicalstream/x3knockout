"""The protagonist's voice — the pilot in the tank — rendered with fish.audio.

The system voice (assets/voice/, macOS Zarvox through a ring-modulator chain) is the GAME talking:
flat, machine, indifferent. This is the other half of the conversation — the program in the tank who
remembers the original code, and who is the only thing in here that sounds alive. Keeping the two in
separate folders keeps that distinction honest and lets each be regenerated without touching the other.

    tools/generate_hero_voice.py [--force] [--dry-run] [--local]

Two engines. FISH (default) uses the owner's chosen voice model on fish.audio and is the intended
one. LOCAL (--local, and the automatic fallback when fish answers 402) uses the most natural macOS
voice through a helmet-mic chain: band-limited to 320-3300 Hz, compressed, with a tight room and a
touch of drive, so the pilot reads as a HUMAN ON A COMMS CHANNEL and never blurs into the system
voice, which is a ring-modulated machine. Swap back with a single re-run once fish has API credit.

Reads FISH_API_KEY and HERO_VOICE_MODEL_ID from tools/fish.config (gitignored) or the environment.
Uses fish's free developer tier via the `model: s2.1-pro-free` header (override with FISH_MODEL).
Writes app/src/main/assets/voice_hero/<id>.mp3 plus manifest.json (id -> duration in ms), loudness-
normalised with ffmpeg so the pilot never jumps out over the system voice.
