/**
 * ONE FLOOR, TWO SPEAKERS.
 *
 * The game has two voices and the contrast between them is the point, so the one thing they must
 * never do is talk over each other — two speech tracks summed on a head-worn display is not a
 * conversation, it is mud. The bus is the floor: whoever holds it speaks, and the other one waits.
 *
 * It is deliberately asymmetric. The SYSTEM can CUT THE PILOT OFF ([preempt], used by urgent lines
 * — a wave, a hit, a derez); the pilot never interrupts anybody and simply waits its turn, and
 * gives up if it has waited past its patience. That is a mixing rule and a characterisation at the
 * same time: the system is the game and gets to speak; the pilot is a program talking back, and the
 * lines it loses are the ones it would have thrown away anyway.

/**
 * A pre-rendered voice track: `assets/<dir>/<id>.<ext>` plus a `manifest.json` of clip durations.
 * Two are built on it:
 *
 *  - THE SYSTEM — the `voice` directory, m4a, macOS Zarvox through a ring-modulator/crusher chain.
 *    Flat, machine, indifferent. It narrates the lore crawl and states facts.
 *  - THE PILOT — the `voice_hero` directory, mp3, the owner's fish.audio model. The program whose
 *    game was stolen, talking back over its own code.
 *
 * One MediaPlayer on a dedicated thread, one line at a time from a queue, arbitrated by a shared
 * [VoiceBus]. An urgent line clears THIS voice's queue, interrupts its own current line and
 * preempts the other voice; otherwise a line always finishes its sentence. [onLineStart] fires on
 * the voice thread when a line actually begins — the intro crawl reveals its text on that beat.
 *
 * PATIENCE. A queued line carries how long it is willing to wait for the floor. A throwaway pilot
 * quip gets a second and a half and is dropped if the system is still talking; a scripted retort —
 * the pilot answering a wave announcement or a game over — gets several seconds, because arriving
 * late is the whole idea. A stale line is worse than no line, so nothing waits forever.
