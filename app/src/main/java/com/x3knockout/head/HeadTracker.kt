/**
 * 3-DoF head look for the tank's periscope. TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR (present on the X3 Pro as a
 * QTI hardware sensor) → rotation matrix → remapCoordinateSystem(AXIS_X, AXIS_Z) → getOrientation,
 * which is the recipe the shipped Everyday app proved on this exact hardware. Output is yaw/pitch in
 * radians relative to a recentre reference: yaw + = looking right, pitch + = looking up. Smoothed on
 * the GL thread (τ 35 ms) so the maze never jitters, with shortest-arc wrapping for yaw.

     * looking down at the desk — which is what you do when you are reaching for a phone or reading

     *
     * THE CLAMP is why this is a reference and not just a subtraction. An unclamped pitch datum
     * lets a player bake an absurd rest pose into the run: recentre while staring at your shoes
     * and looking level would then read as sixty degrees UP, so the horizon really would be at
     * your feet and the game would be unplayable in the other direction. [PITCH_REF_MAX] bounds
     * how much of a bad head pose can be adopted, so the worst case is a horizon a few degrees
     * off rather than an inverted one — and someone who genuinely starts bent over gets most of
     * the correction and can look level for the rest.
